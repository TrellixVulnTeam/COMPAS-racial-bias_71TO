# COMPAS Racial Bias Analysis and Score Prediction
## Data Description
Racial Bias in inmate COMPAS reoffense risk scores for Florida (ProPublica).

Data, provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/compass?select=cox-violent-parsed_filt.csv), contains variables used by the COMPAS algorithm in scoring defendants, along with their outcomes within 2 years of the decision, for over 10,000 criminal defendants in Broward County, Florida.

2 different datasets are implemented in the analysis: 
- *"compas-scores-raw.csv"* which is the raw scores
- *"cox-violent-parsed.csv"* which is the Compass Score after some parsing and cleaning.
